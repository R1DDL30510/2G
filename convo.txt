User: ok you can check the new report with the timestamp 15.05
Assistant: The 15:05 sweep logged in `docs/CONTEXT_RESULTS_2025-09-16_15-05-26.md:1` still shows the CPU run profile: the latency values sit in the ~30s range and the table matched the “safe” CPU plan (2k/4k/8k/12k tokens). The script only produces that layout when `-CpuOnly` is true (`scripts/context-sweep.ps1:17-29`), so PowerShell is still feeding the switch—likely because the command history repeated the earlier call or a default parameter rule exists.

To confirm a GPU pass:

- Re-run from a fresh session with the exact command `./scripts/context-sweep.ps1 -Safe -WriteReport` (no `-CpuOnly` present).
- Beforehand, clear active Ollama sessions so it doesn’t fall back:
  ```
  $id = docker compose -f infra/compose/docker-compose.yml ps -q ollama
  docker exec -i $id ollama stop all
  ```
- If you use `PSDefaultParameterValues`, remove any entry for `CpuOnly`.

After that, the follow-up report should show higher latencies for the larger contexts (and no `[CPU]` tag in the console output).
