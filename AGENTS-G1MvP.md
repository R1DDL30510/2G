Repository Guidelines
=====================

This legacy guidance file now defers to [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the authoritative workflow, coding style, and testing requirements. Keeping a single source eliminates drift between duplicated documents.

Always read `AGENTS.md` before making changes; it applies to the entire repository.
