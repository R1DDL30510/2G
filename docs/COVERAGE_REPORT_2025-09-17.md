# Coverage Assessment – 2025-09-17

## Executive Summary
- A minimal Python-based smoke suite plus a GitHub Actions workflow (`smoke-tests`) now assert the integrity of `infra/compose/docker-compose.yml`, `modelfiles/`, and `.env.example`. These checks improve confidence in configuration drift but provide structural assertions only, so effective runtime coverage remains near 0%.
- Manual validation is still limited to ad-hoc verification and CPU-only context sweeps; there is no GPU sweep evidence or regression history to demonstrate stable performance under production-like loads.
- Coverage tooling that measures runtime behaviour, CI gates enforcing thresholds, and persistent coverage artifacts remain absent, so the stack is **not release ready** by industrial standards until deeper automated verification is implemented.

## Scope
- Infrastructure definitions under `infra/compose/` and the PowerShell automation surface in `scripts/`.
- Operational documentation in `docs/`, including `RELEASE_v2025-09-16.md`, `STACK_STATUS_2025-09-16.md`, and the `CONTEXT_RESULTS_*` artifacts.
- The absence of application source under `src/` alongside a newly established `tests/` smoke suite focused on infrastructure metadata.

## Methodology
- Reviewed repository layout to confirm the new Python smoke suite, identify remaining gaps in unit/integration coverage, and inventory CI workflows.
- Analyzed the latest release and stack status reports to understand existing manual validation practices and environment constraints.
- Inspected context sweep outputs to establish the current level of manual functional coverage.
- Assessed infrastructure scripts and the new GitHub Actions workflow to determine how smoke automation could expand toward runtime coverage instrumentation.

## Findings

### Automated Test & Coverage Inventory
| Layer | Current Assets | Coverage Result | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Unit tests | None | 0% (no instrumentation) | No application modules under `src/` and no unit-level tests beyond infrastructure smoke assertions.
| Integration / smoke tests | Python `pytest` smoke suite + `smoke-tests` GitHub Action | Structural assertions only (no runtime coverage) | Validates compose definitions, Modelfiles, and `.env.example` defaults; still relies on manual bring-up for runtime behaviour.
| Performance / regression sweeps | `scripts/context-sweep.ps1` safe mode runs | 0% automated | Only CPU-only sweeps were captured; GPU paths remain unverified and unscheduled.

### Manual Validation Baseline
- `docs/RELEASE_v2025-09-16.md` now captures the absence of GPU validation and reiterates that evidence directories remain empty until automation publishes results.
- Context sweep outputs (`docs/CONTEXT_RESULTS_2025-09-16_15-05-26.md` and `docs/CONTEXT_RESULTS_2025-09-16_15-17-49.md`) show CPU-only runs, indicating manual invocation of the safe profile without GPU acceleration.
- `docs/STACK_STATUS_2025-09-16.md` notes that PowerShell and Docker were unavailable in the assessment environment, preventing automated script execution during the last verification pass.
- Model automation gaps persist: `scripts/model.ps1 create-all` excludes the GPU variant referenced in documentation, so operators must create it manually before running GPU sweeps.

### Tooling & Reporting Availability
- `.github/workflows/smoke-tests.yml` runs the new pytest suite on every push and pull request, but there are still no coverage configuration files (e.g., `coverage.py`, `jest.config.js`, Pester coverage directives) to measure runtime behaviour or emit artifacts.
- PowerShell automation exists for compose lifecycle and evaluation, yet apart from the structural smoke suite, it remains uninvoked by any continuous integration workflow or scheduled job.
- Evidence directories under `docs/evidence/` are empty, reinforcing that automated artifact capture has not been established.

## Gap Analysis & Risks
- **Quality Risk:** Structural smoke assertions reduce configuration drift, but the absence of runtime integration and script-level tests still allows regressions to ship undetected, increasing operational outage risk.
- **Performance Risk:** Absence of GPU-enabled sweeps and telemetry prevents early detection of degradation when enabling CUDA workloads.
- **Compliance Risk:** Without reproducible coverage artifacts, the project cannot satisfy audit or release-management standards that require repeatable validation evidence.
- **Operational Risk:** Manual procedures rely on access to PowerShell and Docker, yet prior assessments occurred on hosts without those tools, indicating inconsistent operator environments.

## Recommendations
1. Expand the new Python smoke suite with runtime health checks (e.g., compose bring-up probes, HTTP availability assertions) and adopt Pester coverage for PowerShell automation while seeding a `src/` + `tests/` scaffolding for future application code.
2. Integrate coverage tooling (e.g., Pester `CodeCoverage`, `pytest --cov`, or `nyc`) into the existing CI pipeline so every push publishes HTML/XML artifacts to `docs/evidence/coverage/`.
3. Extend `scripts/context-sweep.ps1` automation to run GPU-enabled sweeps on schedule, capturing metrics in Markdown and JSON for regression tracking.
4. Define release gates requiring ≥80% coverage for automation scripts and successful GPU sweeps before tagging a release, and document the gate results alongside release notes.
5. Add environment validation steps to `bootstrap.ps1` to assert the presence of PowerShell 7+, Docker, and coverage tooling, failing fast when prerequisites are missing.

## Release Readiness Assessment
- **Recommendation:** Block the release. Ship only after automated tests with measurable coverage, GPU-enabled sweeps, and CI-driven artifact retention are in place.
- **Next Validation Window:** Reassess once coverage reports are generated and stored under `docs/evidence/coverage/` for at least one successful pipeline run.
