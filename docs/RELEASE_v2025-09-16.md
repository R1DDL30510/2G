# Release Report: v2025.09.16

## Release Summary
- Status: Documentation-only freeze capturing infrastructure scaffolding; runtime validation remains pending.
- Scope: Confirmed manifest integrity and manual CPU-only context sweeps; GPU acceleration, telemetry capture, and evidence exports are deferred.
- Audit Window: 16 Sep 2025 (local verification on Windows 11 Pro for Workstations with missing Docker/Python/Git tooling at capture time).

## Validation & Coverage Overview
- Manual Checks: Stack bring-up was referenced from prior sessions; current evidence is limited to safe-mode CPU context sweeps with no GPU confirmation. Operators must re-run verification once CUDA hosts are available.
- Automation: Structural pytest smoke tests exist but measure configuration only; no runtime or coverage instrumentation is present. Context sweep scripts remain manual and produced no GPU artifacts for this release.
- Risk Notes: With automated regression tests absent and `docs/evidence/` empty, this release should be considered non-production until GPU sweeps and coverage publishing are in place.

## Issues & Resolutions
- Open: GPU enablement has not been revalidated in this cut; Ollamaâ€™s GPU Modelfile must be created manually until `scripts/model.ps1 create-all` is updated.
- Open: Compose images remain pinned (`ollama/ollama:0.3.14`, `ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:v0.3.7`, `qdrant/qdrant:v1.15.4`); track upstream CVEs prior to upgrades.
- Open: Evidence generation is outstanding; `docs/evidence/` contains no telemetry, coverage, or benchmark artifacts.
- Watchlist: Qdrant persistence depends on existing `data/qdrant` volume; ensure backups before pruning containers.

## Dependency & Image Matrix
- Ollama Runtime: `ollama/ollama:0.3.14` (GPU-enabled; volumes mapped to `models/` cache and `modelfiles/`).
- Open WebUI: `ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:v0.3.7` (auth toggle via `OPENWEBUI_AUTH`).
- Qdrant Vector DB: `qdrant/qdrant:v1.15.4` storing data under `data/qdrant`.
- Scripts: PowerShell helpers under `scripts/` (compose, model lifecycle, evaluation).
- NVIDIA Toolkit: Accessed via container runtime; ensure host drivers match CUDA requirements (no container image modifications in this release).

## Configuration Snapshot
- Environment Variables: ports `WEBUI_PORT=3000`, `OLLAMA_PORT=11434`, `QDRANT_PORT=6333`; storage paths `MODELS_DIR=./models`, `DATA_DIR=./data`; authentication flag `OPENWEBUI_AUTH=false` (toggle before exposing beyond localhost).
- Compose Overrides: GPU access declared by `gpus: all` and `NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=compute,utility` for the Ollama service.
- Network Bindings: Localhost endpoints  WebUI `3000/tcp`, Ollama `11434/tcp`, Qdrant `6333/tcp`.
- Persistence: Model cache under `models/` (git-ignored), service state under `data/` with directory-per-service segmentation.

## Operational Checklist
1. Bootstrap environment file: `./scripts/bootstrap.ps1 -PromptSecrets` to copy `.env`, create directories, and regenerate `docs/ENVIRONMENT.md` on a fully provisioned host.
2. Start stack: `./scripts/compose.ps1 up` (uses `infra/compose/docker-compose.yml`).
3. Verify services: `./scripts/compose.ps1 logs` or `docker compose -f infra/compose/docker-compose.yml ps` and capture telemetry snapshots (`nvidia-smi`, health endpoints).
4. Model management: `./scripts/model.ps1 list` and `create-all`, followed by manual creation of `llama31-8b-gpu` until the automation gap is closed.
5. Evaluation: `./scripts/context-sweep.ps1 -Safe -WriteReport` with GPU access enabled; archive Markdown/JSON outputs in `docs/evidence/`.

## Next Steps
- Update model automation to include the GPU profile and document the workflow until the script lands.
- Execute GPU-enabled context sweeps and integrate them with CI so evidence lands in `docs/evidence/`.
- Expand automated smoke tests (pytest, Pester) with coverage tracking to gate releases.
- Document and rehearse recovery procedures for Qdrant and WebUI volumes, alongside GPU telemetry collection during inference runs.
- Establish a cadence to review pinned image tags and apply security updates after validation.
