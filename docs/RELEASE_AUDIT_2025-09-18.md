# Release Readiness Audit – 2025-09-18

## Executive Summary
- The repository contains a mature infrastructure scaffold with Docker Compose definitions, PowerShell automation, and smoke testing, yet runtime validation and GPU evidence still lag behind release-grade expectations.
- Environment configuration is now centralized in `.env.example`, including a repository-scoped `LOG_FILE` path so operators no longer rely on stray template files.
- Documentation, evidence captures, and roadmap artifacts are extensive; keeping them synchronized with evolving automation is the primary ongoing challenge.

## Scope & Approach
- Reviewed infrastructure definitions under `infra/compose/` alongside automation in `scripts/` to confirm lifecycle coverage and GPU defaults.
- Inspected Python smoke tests, Pester assertions, and the `smoke-tests` workflow to gauge automated coverage and artifact retention.
- Surveyed documentation (`docs/`), roadmap plans, and historical evidence to understand operational expectations and outstanding risks.
- Normalised environment configuration by deleting the unused `-G1MvP.env` file and migrating its logging placeholder into `.env.example`.

## Repository Inventory Snapshot
| Area | Key Assets | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| Container orchestration | `infra/compose/docker-compose.yml`, `infra/compose/docker-compose.ci.yml` | Production file pins GPU-enabled images while CI overlay forces CPU mode for portability. |
| Automation scripts | `scripts/compose.ps1`, `scripts/bootstrap.ps1`, `scripts/context-sweep.ps1`, `scripts/model.ps1`, `scripts/clean/*` | Compose lifecycle, environment bootstrapping, context sweeps, and telemetry capture are all scripted in PowerShell. |
| Model definitions | `modelfiles/llama31-8b-*.Modelfile` | Long-context variants and a GPU-tuned profile inherit from `llama3.1:8b`. |
| Tests | `tests/config/test_env_example.py`, `tests/infra/test_docker_compose.py`, `tests/modelfiles/test_modelfiles.py`, `tests/pester/scripts.Tests.ps1` | Smoke assertions cover `.env.example`, Compose manifests, Modelfiles, and script switches. |
| Documentation & evidence | `docs/*.md`, `docs/evidence/**`, `roadmap/*.md` | Release notes, architecture, environment fingerprints, coverage analysis, and backlog planning are well catalogued. |

## Automation & Testing Overview
| Layer | Current Coverage | Evidence |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Python smoke tests | Validate `.env.example`, Compose manifests, and Modelfiles for structural drift. | `tests/config/test_env_example.py`, `tests/infra/test_docker_compose.py`, `tests/modelfiles/test_modelfiles.py` |
| PowerShell assertions | Pester suite confirms script switches and profile declarations. | `tests/pester/scripts.Tests.ps1` |
| CI pipeline | `smoke-tests` workflow runs pytest, Pester, CPU compose bring-up, health probes, safe context sweep, and telemetry capture. | `.github/workflows/smoke-tests.yml` |
| Evidence trail | Benchmarks and environment reports stored under `docs/evidence/` from prior sessions. | `docs/evidence/benchmarks/**`, `docs/evidence/environment/**` |
| Coverage gaps | No automated GPU sweeps or runtime inference assertions; coverage metrics remain qualitative only. | `docs/COVERAGE_REPORT_2025-09-17.md`, `roadmap/testing-expansion.md` |

## Scripts & Operational Tooling Review
- `scripts/compose.ps1` wraps Docker Compose actions with an opinionated `ValidateSet`, ensuring consistent lifecycle commands for operators.【F:scripts/compose.ps1†L1-L23】
- `scripts/bootstrap.ps1` provisions `.env`, creates evidence directories, captures environment reports, and wires context sweep defaults so diagnostics stay reproducible.【F:scripts/bootstrap.ps1†L1-L120】
- `scripts/context-sweep.ps1` and `scripts/eval-context.ps1` expose CPU/GPU profiles with safe-mode throttling, generating Markdown evidence when invoked via CLI or CI.【F:scripts/context-sweep.ps1†L1-L40】
- `scripts/clean/bench_ollama.ps1` and `scripts/clean/capture_state.ps1` benchmark inference latency and snapshot system telemetry into `docs/evidence/benchmarks/` and `docs/evidence/state/` respectively.【F:scripts/clean/bench_ollama.ps1†L1-L40】

## Documentation & Evidence Review
- Core guidance lives in `README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/PROJECT_REPORT_2025-09-16.md`, and the dated release notes, offering historical traceability for decisions and operations.【F:README.md†L1-L64】【F:docs/RELEASE_v2025-09-16.md†L1-L64】
- `docs/STACK_STATUS_2025-09-16.md` and `docs/COVERAGE_REPORT_2025-09-17.md` highlight prior validation results and known automation gaps, forming the baseline for this audit.【F:docs/STACK_STATUS_2025-09-16.md†L1-L60】【F:docs/COVERAGE_REPORT_2025-09-17.md†L1-L48】
- Evidence directories capture benchmark iterations and environment fingerprints, though GPU telemetry remains absent in the historical record.【F:docs/evidence/benchmarks/bench-test-20250917-185829/report.md†L1-L40】【F:docs/evidence/environment/environment-report-20250917-175532.md†L1-L40】

## Environment & Configuration
- `.env.example` now includes `LOG_FILE=./logs/stack.log`, consolidating logging configuration in a single template and ensuring all paths remain repository-relative for portability.【F:.env.example†L1-L24】
- Pytest smoke tests enforce the expanded key set and confirm relative paths across models, data, evidence, and logging locations.【F:tests/config/test_env_example.py†L1-L52】
- `.gitignore` ignores `.env`, data/model directories, and now `logs/`, preventing accidental log artifacts from entering version control.【F:.gitignore†L1-L11】

## Gaps & Recommendations
1. Implement GPU-enabled sweeps and runtime inference tests within CI to transition from structural verification to behavioural guarantees.【F:docs/COVERAGE_REPORT_2025-09-17.md†L38-L56】
2. Add coverage instrumentation (pytest `--cov`, Pester CodeCoverage) and persist HTML/XML outputs under `docs/evidence/coverage/` for auditability.【F:roadmap/testing-expansion.md†L5-L13】
3. Expand script-level testing beyond presence checks, covering menu flows (`bootstrap.ps1 -Menu`), failure handling, and benchmarking edge cases.【F:tests/pester/scripts.Tests.ps1†L1-L32】
4. Establish a cadence to refresh environment fingerprints (`docs/ENVIRONMENT.md`) from a fully provisioned host after each significant release candidate.【F:docs/ENVIRONMENT.md†L1-L40】

## Release Decision
- **Status:** Not yet release ready. Structural automation is in place, but GPU validation, runtime assertions, and coverage metrics must be implemented before promoting to production.
- **Next Validation Window:** After GPU sweeps, runtime tests, and coverage artifacts land in CI evidence stores, re-run this audit to confirm release readiness.
